## Description:
Using 2021 data from Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), I analyze the impact of marijuana use on mental health and social connection for young adult aged 18 to 25 years. This study aims to further add a piece in a bigger picture explaining the significant rise of marijuana use for young adult over the past decade. 

## Data & Software:
For the data, since the file is too big for GitHub to upload, please download the data in Delimited format (.txt) by this link: https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/dataset/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-2021-nsduh-2021-ds0001 

This dataset will need 2021 SAMSHA Codebook (upload above or can find in the dataset link) to understand the variable. In this research, the selected sections for collecting data include marijuana use, past-year frequency of marijuana use, adult mental health, substance disorders, and demographics.

For the software, I used Python 3 to collect and clean the data.
